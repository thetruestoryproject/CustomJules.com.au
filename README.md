I started this website on 14/07/2020.
Using it as a place to locate some of my work in progress.

It started out as a project with my P&I class at nida and got turned into my persional blog after I learned the basics of codding. 
I now try to orginise most of my works here. so that i can get a visiual representation of what I have acheaved. 

As this website grows I might add the works of my friends that I work with to showcase their fantastical works.
