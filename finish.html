                <p>The world seems a little confusing for all of us right now doesn’t it? But that’s ok, we’re all dealing with new things in isolation and sometimes unwanted thoughts can overwhelm us. Some of us may even be feeling like we’re losing control of what is real. But that does not mean you have to go through it alone. Now is the time to reach out to your friends and family, they are probably just as confused and needing to talk as you are. The world has shown us that there is joy in bad times and community in isolation, don’t hide from it.
                    Always know there is no shame in needing help, especially in this time, and there are people you can contact in the links below who are always ready to talk. So stay safe, keep a healthy mind as well as a healthy body.
