                <h1>19/04/2020</h1>
                <p>I have been debating with myself about whether I should make this post or not. It felt too personal or too weird to have out in the public, but I couldn’t escape the feeling that sharing this project with you guys would help me get the experience off my chest. I have been consciously open with my audience about my anxiety and the way it affects me and my work, and you guys know how much I care about normalising mental health and self-care for young people.
                    </p>
                    <p>So… Ever since we went into lockdown my anxiety has been going wild, and I know I’m not alone; there have been more than enough Buzzfeed compilations of funny tweets of people feeling the same way, I don’t even think I’m ready to talk about Tik Tok right now. I was almost getting used to the feeling of sensory sensitivity and panic that settle over me every time my brain starts getting anxious. This felt like the new normal and I was powerless against not only this pandemic but also against my own mental state, which is never a healthy headspace to live in.
                    </p>
                    <p>Last Tuesday after I logged off from my last zoom meeting for the day about the pre-production of a project that has been shelved for the right now and I could feel my body start to tense up. I know my anxiety well enough at this point that I have a game plan to hold back full-blown panic attacks. I rugged myself up burrito style in my duvet, turned my lights off and just focused on my breathing, and keeping my thoughts in the present. Then this anxiety manifests a new way.
                    </p>
                    <p>I was looking out my window, my eyes blurring in and out of focus, creating splotches of colour of the lights on my street, when I began to hear voices very faintly. The sensation you sometimes have in dreams of not being to see or hear clearly but knowing with absolute certainty what things are. The street lights spoke to one another in words I couldn’t understand and couldn’t block out with a pillow over my ears. I knew it wasn't a dream, but it felt too real to be anything else.
                    </p>
                    <p>I still feel uneasy about it but couldn’t help but turn this episode into something to help explain. Describing it in words isn’t enough.
